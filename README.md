# Hackflix 🎬

## Overview

### Project summary

Hackflix is an app that helps you decide what to watch on Netflix. You provide the Hackflix with your preferences and it filters the 4000+ movies and TV shows to match those preferences as best as possible. Kiss Netflix-related-decision-paralysis goodbye, because Hackflix is here to cut down the insurmountable amount of content Netflix has to offer into a manageable selection based on what you actually want to watch.
